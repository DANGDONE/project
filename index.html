<p>Dangling pointers have become an important class of software bugs that could result in use-after-free and double-free vulnerabilities. 
The effects of their exploitation can lead to information leakage, privilege elevation or even control-flow hijacking.
So far, only few approaches are proposed to protect against dangling pointers and most of them incur high overhead.
In this paper we present a lightweight approach, named DANGDONE, to eliminate dangling pointers during the compilation time.
Because the root cause of a dangling pointer is that the pointer and its aliases are not nullified after the objects they point-to are
deallocated,
DANGDONE achieves the protection via three steps:
(1) inserting new pointers point to vulnerable pointers, (2) using new pointers to keep track of aliases vulnerable pointers, and (3) 
automatically nullifying pointers (a.k.a. intermediate pointers) whose memory contents are explicitly deallocated.
DANGDONE is implemented as the compile-time instrumentation and transformation which require no intervention from programmers. 
Then the Nullification of the explicit freed pointer will eliminate all dangling pointers that are aliases of the freed pointer.
We also design a conservative static analysis method to reduce the unnecessary transformation. 
Experimental results show that DANGDONE can protect the target software (the SPEC CPU benchmarks and programs with known CVE) with
negligible performance overhead (<1% with the proposed static analysis).</p>

<p>The basic idea of DANGDONE is as follows: first inserts an new pointer pointing to the pointer which is marked as vulnerable
by static analysis, and then the new pointer is used to keep the pointer propagation consistent with the vulnerable pointer. 
Note that aliases of the vulnerable pointer are also vulnerable, so they are all have the corresponding new pointers, which make 
it possible to keep the pointer propagation consistent with the vulnerable pointer. The instrumentation will make all aliases of 
the new pointer point to one vulnerable pointer. Then we replace uses of the vulnerable pointer with the new pointer if the vulnerable
pointer is dereferenced. When the vulnerable pointer is deallocated, DANGDONE nullifies the freed pointers automatically.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
